            HAPPYY VALENTINE AVIII <br>
            YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO MEE AND IK THIS IS NOT A GOOD LOOKING PAGE BUT HEHE SORIII <br>
            Babyyyyy omggg FINALLY WE MAKINGGGG THISSS WEEKKKK  EEEEEEE FEELSSSS SOOOO GOODDDDDDD ✨‼️‼️ <br>
            AND FRRRRR ajj VALENTINES DAY H AND BRO AS WE KNOW 7 months 🤩💢to out anniversary and well i told ya all that i wanted to say then only but well YOU MEAN SMM TO ME AND I CAN WRITE ENDLESS STUFF TO YOUUUUUUUUUU AND STILL MEAN EACH AND EVERYY THINGG 💝😃 <br>
            Well not that you finally locked in and in awe that i made  this for you ima tell you this is  ntgggggg i had thought of smmmm to do 🙂‍↕️🥺but bc hua ni and i hate myself for that and trust me thisis a least i can doo 😔💥💘 <br>
            I STARTED THIS WEEK WITH A WELL BOUNDED PROPOSAL OF YOU BEING MY VALENTINE AND SINCE YOU MY JAAANUU SAID YESS IT WAS ON ME TO MAKE IT THE BESTTTTT 😉🥰 <br>
            BUT IKIK THINGS WENT SOUTH AND  LITERALLY WENT SOUTH ON THE LAST DATEEEE EEEE SORYYYYYY 🤗 <br>
            BUT YEPPPP I HAD TO  FINISH THIS OFF VERYY NICELYY <br>
            They sayy love true love happnes at first sight i mean yea u feel that woah as is i like her types but i believe love is somewhat like trust and they both go hand in hand yet work differently in different scenarios🌟 <br>
            I believe that love is also built and thats a bond and this bond is seen all over the nature its what makes  very naturall 💫🌟 <br>
            Idk if i even make sense rn cuz ig not the right words but well here it goes <br>
            I believe that as a bond gets tighter harder and deeper the more love is developed and it is endless🌍 <br>
            And well what happend to us is LOVEEEE 🌸AND WE BOTH ARE IN LOVEEE AND SO WE DO REALLY TRUST US WITH OUR LIVES <br>
            ppl missuss this trust and thats such a unforgiving thing its like attacking from to behind that to someone who is weapon less <br>
            And wow thats js so shit but i believe that like a flower blooms🌻 and turns into a very beautiful one and thats only cuz the nature had faith thats ill bloom like a seed in the soil grows cuz the mature has faith that itll 🌸☘️bloom but its not always the faith thats counted other factors like caring and kindness are some major ones too and thats why trust faith belif kindness and caring when done in the right ammout and to the right person with the right intentions never fails and thats why its called love 💐 <br>
            Love is so commonly used and ngl the power of that word is disintegrating and thats wrong 🥀 <br>
            When a person truly understand whats that is then he she is on the right track and me saying all this doesnt mean ik MORE THAN YOU OR AM SUPERIOR TO YOU noo you have more experience than me and ofc more knowledge am js tryna tell you how ik stuff 🌞🦔 <br>
